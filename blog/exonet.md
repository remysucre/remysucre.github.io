The internet turns 56 today.
As a millenial who grew up during the web's golden age,
 it fills my heart with sadness to see the once-free forum,
 flowing with creativity and curiousity,
 turning into a wasteland, filled with deception and manipulation.
The dream machine that opened a wonderous window to my younger self
 has now been weaponized to exploit the vulnerable and incite violence.

Over the years, I have strayed away from the online world that 
 I onced called home.
First, I logged out of my social media accounts after 
 a heated argument with my college classmates
 that left everyone shaken.
Then, after witnessing some of those who I respected the most
 abandon their dignity -- and for some, their jobs too --
 just to win some online shouting match,
I made a vow to never log in again, even though that
 will disadvantage my research career where
 fame comes with its perks.
Still, I kept my guilty pleasure of scrolling Reddit,
 partly to pretend I was still young and hip,
 and partly because society has left third places to crumble,
 to keep us trapped inside the net of our technolords.
Finally, I gave up the memes too last month
 in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination.
In addition to the killing itself whose graphic details broke through
 the neglected moderation infrastructure of modern social media, 
 I was disturbed by the online reaction to the event:
 people dissected every shred of information on the assassin, his parents, his grandparents,
 and his roommate, just to score points for their respective political sporting teams.

Once I stepped out of the pandemonium, I remembered a simple fact: none of this is real.
Nearly half of all internet traffic is now driven by bots, with a third of them designed to
 promote propaganda.[^1]
The other half of human users are algorithmically divided into echo chambers
 to spread and amplify lies and vitriol,
 so that we are kept busy fighting each other while the tyrants continue
 to consolidate power.
The internet, as I knew and loved, is dead.
What remains is a soulless body being strung around by the puppet masters 
 for a grotesque show of light and shadow.

Yet there is hope. Upon the decaying corpse of the World Wide Web a new movement has taken root.
With [content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin) 
 [blockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Vanced), 
 [alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitter) [frontends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invidious), 
 and [web archives](https://blog.archive.org/trillion/), 
 an **exonet** emerges through the work of thousands.
Wrapping itself around the internet, the exonet defangs websites,
 ridding them of dark patterns,
 so that users can access information without sacrificing their rights.
Unsurprisingly, these rebellious acts provoked swift and sustained suppression
 from the powers that be.
But every time one goes down, more pop back up with renewed vigor.

> "The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear."  -- Nemik in *Andor*

"But isn't that stealing?" You ask.
True, there is a difference between protecting your privacy and
 depriving artists and journalists of their rightful compensation.
But there is also a middle ground between just giving up
 and reckless piracy.
Since the root of the internet's evil is surveillance capitalism,
 our goal is to dismantle this economic model by making it
 no longer profitable.
For example, I will gladly pay a fair price for a newspaper's quality reporting,
 but if they put out their "free articles" as bait to steal my data,
 they have no rights to be mad if I know how to rip out their trackers.

The internet is one of the most marvelous technological achievements of humanity.
And despite its many flaws, it did and continues to bring us connection, knowledge, and joy.
It is simply too important to fall into the hands of the oligarchs.
So what can you do to help?
Start with doing what's right *for you*.
[Choose](https://www.privacytools.io) [services](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tools/)
 that respect you rather than sell you as a product.
Adopt technologies that are [free and open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), 
 and protect yourself with the tools provided by the exonet.
Then spread the word, tell your friends and family to stand up for themselves and their loved ones.
Support the exonet movement however you can,
 be it a donation, a patch, or hosting an instance.
And if you are able, align your career with goals that serve the public rather than drive profits.



The internet is nothing but a ball of wires without its people, 
 and it's up to us to shape its future for the benefit of all.
