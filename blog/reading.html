<h1 id="reading-papers-in-a-paper-reading-seminar">Reading Papers in a
Paper-Reading Seminar</h1>
<p>I’ve been to quite a few paper-reading seminars, and this is roughly
how things go: during the first session, the instructor comes up with a
list of papers and puts them in google sheets; each student would then
sign up to present some paper based on its title (and sometimes also the
abstract). Each week, some student(s) would read a paper, prepare some
slides, and present. Ideally, everyone in the audience would have read
the paper, taken some notes, and ask insightful questions and
participates in discussion. Well, ideally.</p>
<p>Here is how it really goes: most people who are not presenting would
spend no more than 1 hour reading the paper, and usually much less.
Sometimes they would just look at the abstract, skim the figures in the
experiments, and give up halfway through the introduction. During the
presentation, someone asks an insightful question that doesn’t have an
obvious answer. The presenters wave their hands and give some vague
response. The audience start to furiously fumble through the paper
looking for the answer, only to get more confused. Finally you squint
your eyes and goes “hmmm OK let’s move on”. By the end of the session,
everyone leaves with some “takeaways” that can probably be generated by
ChatGPT.</p>
<p>OK, I admit I’m overly pessimistic, but in short, the biggest problem
with the standard “paper-reading seminar” is that <strong>no one reads
the papers</strong>. I wanted to fix that when I taught a <a
href="https://remy.wang/cs249qo/">seminar on database query
optimization</a>. I also had another unique challenge due to UCLA’s
course structure: we have ~2h of lecture time per session and 2 sessions
per week. Presenting each paper roughly takes an hour, so to fill the
time we would have to assign 4 papers per week, and that’s simply too
many for anyone to read.</p>
<p>So I decided to do an experiment and <strong>actually read the papers
in class</strong>. By construction this solves the first problem:
everyone who comes to class will read the paper; it also solves the
problem of having to fill 4h per week, because reading a paper takes
much longer than presenting one. Of course we don’t just sit in silence
and read for 2h straight. Here’s how it works: before each lecture, I
spend the morning reading the paper in depth, taking notes on parts to
focus on and pitfalls to help the students. In class, we read in 5 to
10-minute increments. For example, I’ll say: “now let’s spend 10 minutes
to read Section 1. Your goal is to understand what a join order is, and
make sure you can explain what’s going on in Figure 1. The way they
define a query graph is a bit confusing, but it’s really just a graph
where the nodes are relations and there’s an edge between 2 relations if
they join with each other”. Then, after 10 minutes, I ask some basic
questions to make sure people understood the main concepts and spend
some time for further discussion.</p>
<p>We just finished the course last week, and I think it went quite
well. Many students commented that they would not nearly have understood
the papers without the close guidance in class. In fact, I had never
managed to understand the papers so well despite having read them in
previous reading groups. Another nice side effect is that the lectures
are not nearly as tiring as a regular 2h lecture, because I’m talking
only half the time. Actually, I find the 10 min intervals where people
read in silence rather relaxing, kind of like a collective meditation
session (one of my students affectionately calls the seminar “a book
club”).</p>
<p>Some things I might change: spending a whole morning per lecture to
prep is nontrivial, at least compared to the traditional seminar where
the only “work” the professor needs to do is coming up with the papers.
Maybe when my students are more senior I will trust them to lead the
sessions. For our class we had a final project. What the students
managed to put together was actually pretty impressive. But I think next
time I’ll ask people to write reading notes instead, and collect them
into a blog like <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250126130354/https://blog.acolyer.org/2021/02/08/the-ants-and-the-pheromones/">the
morning paper</a>. But if I make this into a homework, people will
probably GPT everything :(</p>
