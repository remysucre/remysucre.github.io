<h1 id="duckdb-considered-harmful">DuckDB Considered Harmful</h1>
<p>I love DuckDB. It’s <a
href="https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants">decades
of database research</a> in a <a
href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases">single binary</a>,
blazingly fast and completely free. But systems like it have been
weaponized by reviewers for DB conferences to carelessly dismiss
important research. I have served as a reviewer for 10+ database
conferences and journals and written my fair share of papers, and there
is a worrying trend that I call the “DuckDB effect”: many reviewers take
a naïve, irresponsible approach in their work, and blindly reject papers
that do not immediately outperform the state-of-the-art. Their review
usually comes in the form of “why don’t you compare to DuckDB?”.
Sometimes they will show mercy and hand out a Revision to demand such a
comparison, even if the comparison makes no sense. Arguably this is even
worse than outright rejection, because the authors are now incentivized
to hack their way into a win against the best system, and whatever
tricks they come up with usually have nothing to do with the key
insights of the paper. I call this <em>intellectual pollution</em>
because it makes the paper dirty.</p>
<p>So why shouldn’t you compare to DuckDB? Because scientific progress
is not a straight line. If we require every next paper to outperform the
previous one, we are forcing ourselves into a greedy algorithm that will
get trapped in local optima. The relational model itself took decades to
mature and become competitive with earlier navigational systems, and it
took around 30 years for deep learning to be vindicated. Of course,
ideas that can be immediately applied to current systems are valuable
and impactful, but revisiting core principles and restarting from
scratch is more likely to lead to breakthroughs. The latter is
particularly challenging in the context of database research, because
the field is so mature that system architecture has converged to a few
highly optimized key components, and any improvement to one component
will receive diminishing returns. But if we want to bring vitality back
to the field, we have to invest in risky ideas that do not pay off
immediately.</p>
<p>I urge my fellow reviewers to take a more nuanced approach when
evaluating papers. Instead of focusing on numbers, look for insights.
Instead of demanding packaged solutions, judge an idea by its potential.
Use your knowledge and experience to fill in the gaps, and imagine
different futures that a paper makes possible. Don’t just rank papers by
their position on some leaderboard, but ask yourself if you have learned
something new.</p>
