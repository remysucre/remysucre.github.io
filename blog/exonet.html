<h1 class="title">Exonet Manifesto, Part I: Guerrilla Tactics to Take
Back the Internet</h1>
<p class="author">Remy Wang</p>

<p>The internet turns 56 today. As a millenial who grew up during the
web’s golden age, it fills my heart with sadness to see the once-free
forum, flowing with creativity and curiousity, turning into a wasteland,
filled with deception and manipulation. The dream machine that opened a
wonderous window to my younger self has now been weaponized to exploit
the vulnerable and incite violence.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have strayed away from the online world that I
onced called home. First, I logged out of my social media accounts after
a heated argument with my college classmates that left everyone shaken.
Then, after witnessing some of those who I respected the most abandon
their dignity – and for some, their jobs too – just to win some online
shouting match, I made a vow to never log in again, even though that
will disadvantage my research career where fame comes with its perks.
Still, I kept my guilty pleasure of scrolling Reddit, partly to pretend
I was still young and hip, and partly because society has left third
places to crumble, to keep us trapped inside the net of our technolords.
Finally, I gave up the memes too last month in the aftermath of Charlie
Kirk’s assassination. In addition to the killing itself whose graphic
details broke through the neglected moderation infrastructure of modern
social media, I was disturbed by the online reaction to the event:
people dissected every shred of information on the assassin, his
parents, his grandparents, and his roommate, just to score points for
their respective political sporting teams.</p>
<p>Once I stepped out of the pandemonium, I remembered a simple fact:
none of this is real. Nearly half of all internet traffic is now driven
by bots, with a third of them designed to promote propaganda.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The other half of human users are
algorithmically divided into echo chambers to spread and amplify lies
and vitriol, so that we are kept busy fighting each other while the
tyrants continue to consolidate power. The internet, as I knew and
loved, is dead. What remains is a soulless body being strung around by
the puppet masters for a grotesque show of light and shadow.</p>
<p>Yet there is hope. Upon the decaying corpse of the World Wide Web a
new movement has taken root. With <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin">content</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Vanced">blockers</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitter">alternative</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invidious">frontends</a>, and <a
href="https://blog.archive.org/trillion/">web archives</a>, an
<strong>exonet</strong> emerges through the work of thousands. Wrapping
itself around the internet, the exonet defangs websites, ridding them of
dark patterns, so that users can access information without sacrificing
their rights. Unsurprisingly, these rebellious acts provoked swift and
sustained suppression from the powers that be. But every time one goes
down, more pop back up with renewed vigor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so
unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks.
Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.” – Nemik in
<em>Andor</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“But isn’t that stealing?” You ask. True, there is a difference
between protecting your privacy and depriving artists and journalists of
their rightful compensation. But there is also a middle ground between
just giving up and reckless piracy. Since the root of the internet’s
evil is surveillance capitalism, our goal is to dismantle this economic
model by making it no longer profitable. For example, I will gladly pay
a fair price for a newspaper’s quality reporting, but if they put out
their “free articles” as bait to steal my data, they have no rights to
be mad if I know how to rip out their trackers.</p>
<p>The internet is one of the most marvelous technological achievements
of humanity. And despite its many flaws, it did and continues to bring
us connection, knowledge, and joy. It is simply too important to fall
into the hands of the oligarchs. So what can you do to help? Start with
doing what’s right <em>for you</em>. <a
href="https://www.privacytools.io">Choose</a> <a
href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tools/">services</a> that respect
you rather than sell you as a product. Adopt technologies that are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">free and open</a>, and
protect yourself with the tools provided by the exonet. Then spread the
word, tell your friends and family to stand up for themselves and their
loved ones. Support the exonet movement however you can, be it a
donation, a patch, or hosting an instance. And if you are able, align
your career with goals that serve the public rather than drive
profits.</p>
<p>The internet is nothing but a ball of wires without its people, and
it’s up to us to shape its future for the benefit of all.</p>
