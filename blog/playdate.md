# My New (Anti-)Phone Has a Crank

A smartphone is a device designed for large-scale surveillance and propaganda.
It also moonlights as a music player, a map, a wallet, parking meters, 
 restaurant menus, work badges, and the only way to make 
 an appointment with my neightborhood vet.
Over the years, my relationship with my phone has become not so healthy,
 and I've been trying to get out of it for some time now.
But what options do I have? iPhones are only getting bulkier, buggier,
 and more expensive; I swore off Android again after catching
 Google logging every time I touched the screen;
 and I've collected enough "dumb phones" to start a museum of stupidity.
Night after night, I kept searching on my 5 year old iPhone 12 mini
 for its replacement that:

1. Is small enough to fit in a pocket
2. Has a black-and-white, fast display
3. With good battery life

The [Playdate](https://play.date) is all that: it's small enough to fit
 in my **T-shirt** pocket, has a beautiful monochrome LCD screen,
 and has a **replaceable** battery that lasts days.
It's also designed to look like an icecream sandwich,
 and controlled by 2 buttons, a D-pad, and a **crank**.
The people making it also try to do the right things:
 sideloading is as easy as connecting the device via USB
 (or opening a web portal)
 and dropping a file to the right place,
 and the device can be taken apart using a screw driver.
But you may say: "this is just a gaming console, not a phone!"
And you would be right, until about 5 months ago.

In April, Panic quietly added TCP and HTTP support to the Playdate SDK.
This transformed the device from a nostalgic toy into the best phone
 on the market for people who hate phones, like myself.
