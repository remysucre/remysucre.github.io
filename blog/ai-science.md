# An Allegory on Science from AI

A language model predicts the most likely future text given the current text.
This is also how some people do science: they read a bunch of papers, then write a bunch of papers.
But this produces mediocre science at best, because anyone who can read and write can also do that, including a language model.
Real breakthroughs in science happens when someone comes up with the most unlikely idea and stands firmly by it.
Examples include Newton, Einstein, GÃ¶del, and Turing.
Real science happens through *doing*: doing experiments, doing calculations, doing proofs. 
So go pick up your crazy ideas and play with them; there are enough people churning out the most likely next papers, and you aren't missing much.
On the flip side, AI that *does* can become truly powerful, and how AIs do is by writing and running code.
Making a computer write code is also called [program synthesis](cegis.html), and there are plenty of wild ideas there for everyone to play with.
