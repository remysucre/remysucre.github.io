Yes, I'm looking for students to join my lab.
There are two ways you can demonstrate your potential to become a good researcher: 

1. You have made significant contribution to a research project, even if the project has not succeeded yet. 
2. If you don't have any research experience, complete one of the tasks below *independently*.

Most of my research concerns databases and programming languages, but I have a wide range of interests, and you can get me excited about anything if you try.

* Implement a [tree automata minimization algorithm](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/pubs/tr-633.pdf) and use it to [speed up egraph extraction](https://remy.wang/reports/dfta.pdf).

* Use [TACO](http://tensor-compiler.org) to answer queries in the [join ordering benchmark](https://github.com/gregrahn/join-order-benchmark), and try to beat the performance of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org).

* Do the same as a bove, but use some other system with a scheduling language like [Halide](https://halide-lang.org).

* Implement the [improved Yannakakis algorithm](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~arnaud.durand/papers/BDGlongversion.pdf) and try to beat the performance of DuckDB on join order benchmark. You may also use techniques from [factorized databases](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/dan.olteanu/papers/os-sigrec16.pdf).

* Understand the [PANDA algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02503.pdf), implement it, and make a presentation explaining it.

* Understand the [FAQ algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04044), implement it, and make a presentation explaining it.

* Implement [query by direct manipulation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ebakke/research/sieuferd_sigmod2016.pdf).

* Extend Souffle to support [recursive aggregates](https://github.com/souffle-lang/souffle/pull/2263).

* Implement Datalog modulo equivalence.

* Implement and benchmark generalized semi-naive evaluation for Datalog.

* Study how data is used in any recent [breakthough](https://www.quantamagazine.org/videos/2021s-biggest-breakthroughs-in-physics/) in science.

* Implement an SMT solver from scratch.

* Make a screenless smartphone with voice-based UI.

* Make a "digital analog projector": instead of connecting to HDMI, you just put your laptop in front of the camera, and the system automatically applies filters to the video to make it look nice.

* Come up with a dynamic programming algorithm for join order optimization for free join.

* Experiment with different search algorithms in egg.

* Re-implement your favorite paper. To make sure you don't just download the code and run it, implement it using a different programming language.
