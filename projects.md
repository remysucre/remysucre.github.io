I always welcome exceptional students at all levels to join my lab.
There are two ways you can demonstrate your potential to become a good researcher: 

1. You have made significant contribution to a research project, even if the project has not succeeded yet. 
2. If you don't have any research experience, implement one of the algorithms below *independently*
and make a presentation explaining the algorithm.

Independently means you will complete the task by yourself, without any help from me.
Please only contact me when you have made significant progress completing the task.
Each task is roughly equivalent one semester-long course with intense focus.
