Yesterday evening a monster kept following me, from afternoon until dawn. I ran to a train, and he chased me to the station but got onto the wrong car. I could see his shimmering eyes through the layers of windows. Then I ran across a river where he drowned and turned into a chipmunk, quivering under the wheel of a van.

An ambulance fell from her bike in front of a hospital. All the precious blood sample spilled all over the street and she lost her steering wheel. So what? A nurse volunteered to sew her tires first, then run her under some CT scans and MRI.

2 weeks later, the park boy ran to the ambulance, claiming that he has found her steering wheel. Yes, some flies have made it their home. But the keys and the fingerprint of the driver are still there. The ambulance thanked the boy and told him to fuck off.

In dream I was in my high school classroom with B. and several other students. We paid no attention to the teacher, were bored. We wanted to escape. But not through the front door –– not fearing to be caught, but it’s too far away and leads to a boring neighborhood. B. said: “Do you want to take a shortcut with me? It’s not very flat.” We said yes and followed him, jumping out of the window.
There were fewer and fewer places to place our feet, and the wall gets narrower. We were tottering on rusty tiles lying on each other. Finally, there path came to an end and B. took a huge leap to catch a handle on the wall in front. He succeeded and stood on a small area. With us there is a ridiculously fat boy, who is believed impossible to do the same job. I was the next. Looking down, I could tell that we were high up. I kept imagining how the wind will press me to the ground and I would fall into myself and nobody could wake me up.
Nobody want to follow, so we took a detour and climbed down into a military camp. There were nurses around, so we asked them to call the emergency. But we recalled already having rang earlier and informed the personnel about our location, we had to climb back up.
It was a shame to have the nurses rescue us. I woke up humiliated, regretting not making the leap. People don’t die in dreams, anyway.
