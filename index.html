        I'm a PhD student at
        <a href="http://db.cs.washington.edu/">UWDB</a>
        and
        <a href="http://uwplse.org/">PLSE</a>
        advised by
        <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suciu/">Dan Suciu</a>.
        I optimize modern data systems with advanced techniques from
        programming languages and databases.
        <strong> I will start as an Assistant Professor at UCLA in 2024. </strong>

    <p> <em>SIGMOD'23</em>
        We propose
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10841">free join</a>,
        a new join algorithm unifying and generalizing
        traditional binary joins with worst-case optimal joins.
        Free join brings the best of both worlds,
        and outperforms both binary join and WCOJ in practice.
    </p>
    <p> <em>EGRAPHS'22</em>
        We tease out
        <a href="reports/dfta.pdf">deep connections</a>
        among e-graphs, finite-state tree automata,
        and version space algebra.
        By fusing together powerful ideas from these different perspectives,
        we gain orders-of-magnitude speedup
        and discover a new technique for automated proofs.

    <p> <em>PODS'22</em> <strong>Best Paper</strong>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14435">Datalog<sup>o</sup></a>
        is a query language that generalizes datalog.
        It can express a wide range of computation from shortest paths
        to network centrality. In the paper we study its convergence behavior.
    </p>
    <p> <em>SIGMOD'22</em> <strong>Invited to SIGMOD Record</strong>
        We also developed a
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10390">query optimizer</a>
        for datalog<sup>o</sup>
        based on program synthesis.
    </p>
    <p> <em>POPL'22</em>
        Using advanced join algorithms, we made
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02290">pattern matching</a>
        in a rewrite system asymptotically faster.
    </p>
    <p> <em>MLSys'21</em>
        <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/tensat">Tensat</a>
        is an optimizer for deep learning inference using
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03082">equality saturation</a>.
        It achieves state-of-the-art inference speed with very
        fast compilation.
    </p>
    <p> <em>POPL'21</em> <strong>Distinguished Paper</strong>
        <a href="https://egraphs-good.github.io/">egg</a>
        is the rewrite engine underlying a new class of optimizers
        including Tensat and SPORES (see below).
        It implements an efficient algorithm for equality saturation.
    </p>
    <p> <em>OOPSLA'21</em> <strong>Distinguished Paper</strong>
        We used egg to
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10436">invent rewrite rules</a>
        that are in turn given to
        egg itself for equality saturation.
    </p>
    <p> <em>VLDB'20</em>
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3407790.3407799">SPORES</a>
        is an optimizer for large scale linear algebra. It transforms
        linear algebra code through the powerful abstraction of relational algebra.

        I have been very lucky to work with many brilliant undergraduate / master students:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jleang">Jonathan Leang</a>
        meticuously performed many intricate experiments for SPORES.
        Jonathan now works at Snowflake, and at the same time (!!) teaches Databases at UW.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://effect.systems">Yihong Zhang</a>
        turned our idea of relational pattern matching into implementation and a publication.
        With this work, Yihong won 1st place in the PLDI 2021 Student Research Competition.
