            Iâ€™m a PhD student at <a href="http://db.cs.washington.edu/">uwdb</a>
            and <a href="http://uwplse.org/">uwplse</a> advised by
            <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~suciu/">Dan Suciu</a>.
            I optimize modern data systems with advanced techniques from
            programming languages and databases:

        <p>
            <a href=""><u>spores</u></a> is an optimizer for large
            scale linear algebra. It transforms LA code through the powerful
            abstraction of relational algebra. [VLDB'20]
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href=""><u>tamago</u></a> is an optimizer for deep
            learning inference using the technique of equality saturation. It
            achieves state-of-the-art inference speed with extremely fast
            compilation. [under review]
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href=""><u>egg</u></a> is the rewrite engine underlying
            both SPORES and tamago. It implements an efficient algorithm for
            equality saturation. [POPL'21]

            Before coming to Seattle, I was extremely lucky to work with
            Kathleen Fisher and Diogenes Nunez at Tufts. They lead me into
            research and convinced me to keep doing it. Even before that, Norman
            Ramsey taught me almost everything I knew about programming using
            How to Design Programs.
